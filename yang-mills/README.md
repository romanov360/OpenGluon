# Yang–Mills mass gap: the cube estimate (D)

Research notes on one open step of a lattice approach to the Yang–Mills mass gap. Nothing here proves the mass gap.

## Context: where this work comes from

The work continues a research programme on the Yang–Mills mass gap whose paper and notes are public in the
repository [romanov360/4Y-M](https://github.com/romanov360/4Y-M), branch `claude/yang-mills-mass-gap-wf5h8x`. The
paper is `strong-coupling/forest/main.tex` (Bhattacharjee, Bhattacharya, Lockwood, *Explicit lattice Yang–Mills mass
gap for every compact simple group reducing the continuum gap to one cube*, not refereed). References below such as
"Theorem `chartdecay`" are the `\label` names in that file; each is described in words where it is used.

**The programme in one paragraph.**
- **Lattice gauge theory.** Yang–Mills theory is put on a four-dimensional lattice with spacing a. Each link carries a
  group element (for example in SU(2)), and the Wilson action weights each plaquette, the unit square of four links.
- **Proved so far.** A mass gap on the lattice at strong coupling (large spacing): for SU(2) up to β_W ≤ 0.351 and
  for SU(3) up to β_W ≤ 0.77.
- **The reduction.** The gap in the continuum (a → 0) is reduced to two statements:
  - **the cube estimate**: inside one cube of fixed physical size, with the block averages of the field held fixed,
    changing one link on the boundary moves the law of the cube only a little (a Dobrushin–Shlosman condition). It must
    hold uniformly as a → 0, that is, at weak coupling;
  - **existence**: a continuum limit satisfying the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms. This is essentially the Clay problem
    itself.

**Glossary of the pieces of the cube estimate.** The 4Y-M notes (`strong-coupling/forest/D_STATUS.md`) split the cube
estimate into eight pieces, D1–D8. Only these labels are used here:

| label | plain name | what it asks |
|---|---|---|
| D4 | **mass off the chart on non-calm fibres** | control the field configurations that have no nearby small-field configuration |
| D5 | **from local decay to the cube coefficient** | turn the proved decay of correlations inside one fibre into a bound on the cube's response to a boundary change |
| D7 | **large fields are harmless** | show that rare regions of large field do not spoil the bound |
| D8 | **composition across scales** | combine the cube conditions at all scales into one statement (renormalisation group) |

**Other terms.**
- **Fibre.** The set of field configurations inside the cube with the given block averages and boundary.
- **Constrained law.** The Wilson measure restricted to one fibre.
- **Calm.** Every plaquette near the cube is within a tiny angle of the identity: the small-field regime.
- **Chart.** A coordinate patch of the fibre around a calm configuration. The paper proves that correlations decay
  exponentially there (Theorem `chartdecay`).
- **Cube coefficient.** The Wasserstein (W₁) distance between the cube's laws for two boundary conditions that differ at
  one link, divided by the size of that difference.

| file | content | status |
|---|---|---|
| `SURVEY.md` | literature (Bałaban/Dimock, W₁ Dobrushin, Bassalygo–Dobrushin, CCHS, Shen–Zhu–Zhu, Chatterjee, LGT in Lean, 2025–26), with what each means for the four open pieces in the glossary above | survey |
| `d5-calm/D5_CALM.md` | the step "from local decay to the cube coefficient" (D5) for calm boundary data: type-(a) exterior links proved with explicit constant C_* ≤ 7.4·10¹², uniform in β and n; type-(b) links reduced to one one-block large-field remainder; conditional D_c(n, α) for n ≳ 2.3·10¹⁵/α; the non-uniform off-chart term isolated as Conjecture L ("large fields are harmless", D7, in covariance form) | proved / reduced / conjectured, as marked in its §6 |
| `d5-calm/checks/d5_geometry.py` | enumeration of the block-tree geometry (link types, private links, counts), the lattice sum S(α), the constants | `python3 yang-mills/d5-calm/checks/d5_geometry.py` |

Nothing here proves the cube estimate or existence. The off-chart term of D5 is not uniform along the weak-coupling tuning.
