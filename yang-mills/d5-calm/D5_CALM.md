# D5 on calm data: from fibre decay to the constrained cube coefficient

Status: November 2026. Working note, not refereed. It builds on the forest paper `4Y-M/strong-coupling/forest/main.tex`
(branch `claude/yang-mills-mass-gap-wf5h8x`); all labels such as `thm:chartdecay` refer to that file.

## 0. Summary

D5 (`D_STATUS.md` §2) asks for the passage from the fibre decay of Theorem `chartdecay` to the constrained cube
coefficient, with a supremum over boundary conditions. This note does the calm-exterior case.

**Proved:**
- **Lemma 1, the split of the exterior links.** The exterior links that couple to the cube V = A_W come in exactly two
  disjoint kinds:
  - **type (a)**: links that share a plaquette with A_W. They enter no average.
  - **type (b)**: links that enter one cut-off average V♯_k. They share no plaquette with A_W, and they enter exactly
    one average, through a single path.

  This is proved by hand below and checked by enumeration (`checks/d5_geometry.py`).
- **Theorem 1 (D5 for type (a), calm data).** For every type-(a) link j and every calm boundary datum (E, c), the
  local cube coefficient obeys

  c_{V,j}(E, c) ≤ C_* + 120 r λ ε_W(K, λ) |A_W|,  C_* = 480√18 e^{α_G} p̄² S(α_G)^{1/2} ≤ 7.4·10¹².

  - C_* depends neither on λ (so not on β) nor on n, |W| or the background.
  - The second term is the mass off the chart times the oscillations.
- **Corollary 1.** The type-(a) part of K^c_c is at most 4(n/2+1)³ (π/2)(C_* + 120 r λ ε_W |A_W|).

**Reduced, not proved:**
- **Theorem 2 (type (b), a reduction).** For a type-(b) link, transporting the fibre along the eight private links of
  its average gives a λ-independent leading constant C_b ≈ 9.2·10¹³ (explicit). It also gives
  - an O(1/λ) term whose constant is only sketched, and
  - one remainder Ξ_j: the Lipschitz dependence, on E_j, of the constrained measure restricted to the large-path set of
    the single block of j's average.

  Ξ_j is not bounded here. It is a one-block large-field statement, part of D7.
- **Corollary 2 (D_c(n, α) on calm data, conditional).** It needs two inputs:
  - Ξ_j ≤ C_Ξ for every type-(b) link;
  - λ ε_W |A_W| ≤ 1.

  If both hold, the constrained cube condition D_c(n, α) holds on calm data for n ≥ 2.3·10¹⁵/α + O(1) (α ≤ 1/2), with
  C_Ξ entering the threshold linearly. This is the nonabelian counterpart, on calm data, of Theorem `constrainedcube`(iii)
  (Gaussian: n ≥ 2·10¹⁵/α). The two thresholds are of the same size.

**What this does not do:**
- **The off-chart term is not uniform along the tuning.** It is λ ε_W |A_W|, with ε_W ≈ (C/K³)^{45|W|} e^{−3λK²/4}.
  It is small only when λK² ≫ |W| log(…), that is, for β_W ≳ 10³⁹|W|. On cubes of fixed physical size,
  |W| ∼ a⁻⁴ while β ∼ log(1/a), so the bound fails there. This is exactly D4/D7 (Proposition `calmrare`: non-calm
  windows are typical). §5 states the local estimate that would remove the factor |A_W|.
- **Non-calm data are excluded.** Fibres with no calm field and exteriors with no calm completion are D4.

So D5 is closed for type-(a) links on calm data. For type-(b) links it is reduced to one local large-field remainder.
The remaining non-uniformity is moved entirely into a *localised* off-chart estimate, which is the interface with D7.

## 1. Setting and definitions

As in Sec. `ssec:smallfibres`:
- **Lattice and blocks.** G ⊂ U(r) compact, the periodic lattice of side 2L, the tree gauge of Definition `blockgauge`.
  W is the set of blocks of the cube [0, n)⁴ (n even), and A_W the active links with base in ⋃W. **The cube of the
  cube condition is V = A_W**, with |A_W| = 49|W|.
- **Exterior and averages.** An *exterior* E is an assignment of the active links off A_W. Tree links are I and are not
  variables. The averages c = (c_k), k = (y, μ), y ∈ W, are values of the cut-off averages V♯_k of (`eq:cutoff`).
- **The constrained law.** π_{E,c} is the conditional law of e^{−λQ} ∏_{e∈A_W} dU_e given V♯ = c, in the coarea
  version: density e^{−λQ} J⁻¹, J = det(Dc Dc*)^{1/2}, with respect to the Riemannian volume of the fibre
  F_E(c) = {U ∈ G^{A_W} : V♯_k(U, E) = c_k ∀k}. Here Q = Σ_p ‖U_p − I‖²_HS over the plaquettes meeting A_W.
- **Distances.** δ(g, h) = ‖g − h‖_HS (chordal), d_V(U, U′) = Σ_{e∈A_W} δ(U_e, U′_e), and W₁ is the Kantorovich
  distance for d_V. Link distance d(a, b) is the ℓ^∞ distance of midpoints. Geodesic distance on G satisfies
  δ ≤ d_geo ≤ (π/2)δ.

**Definition 1 (calm data).** (E, c) is *calm* with parameters (K, λ, s) if F_E(c) contains a field U^0 with
δ(U^0_p, I) ≤ K/(4√n_P) for every plaquette p with a vertex in a block of W⁺, and the hypotheses of Corollary
`calmfibres` hold at U^0. Two things then hold:
- Theorem `chartdecay` (with Proposition `explicitdecay`: α_G = 2.5·10⁻⁴, p̄_α = ‖P̄‖_{(α)} ≤ 4.8) applies to
  μ = π_{E,c}(· | Φ(Ω_r));
- π_{E,c}(F \ Φ(Ω_r)) ≤ ε_W(K, λ).

Corollary `calmexterior` gives the following. On every exterior with a calm completion, all fibres except a set of
mass ≤ ε″_W in the law of the averages are calm.

**Definition 2 (local cube coefficient).** For an exterior link j, Z ∈ 𝔤 with |Z| = 1, let E_t equal E except at j,
where (E_t)_j = E_j e^{tZ}. Put

c_{V,j}(E, c) = sup_{F, Z} limsup_{t→0} |E_{π_{E_t,c}} F − E_{π_{E,c}} F| / |t|,

the supremum over 1-Lipschitz F for d_V. If t ↦ E_{π_{E_t,c}}F is continuous on [0, T], and c_{V,j}(E_t, c) ≤ C for
every t, then this function is C-Lipschitz, because its Dini derivatives are bounded by C. Hence

W₁(π_{E,c}, π_{E′,c}) ≤ C d_geo(E_j, E′_j) ≤ (π/2) C δ(E_j, E′_j)

whenever the geodesic from E_j to E′_j stays in the calm set. The constrained cube coefficient of D_c, restricted to
calm pairs, is therefore at most (π/2) sup c_{V,j}.

## 2. Lemma 1: the two types of exterior links

**Lemma 1.** Let j be an active link off A_W.
- (i) If j enters some V♯_k, k = (y, μ), y ∈ W, then:
  - j = (x + e_μ, μ) with x ∈ B(y), o_μ(x) = 1, and y + e_μ ∉ W;
  - j enters only the path P_x = U_{x,μ} U_{x+e_μ,μ} of V♯_k, and no other average;
  - no plaquette contains j and a link of A_W.
- (ii) Otherwise j enters no average, and V♯ does not depend on j.
- (iii) The private links of V♯_k, namely (x, μ) with x ∈ B(y) and o_μ(x) = 1, enter no average other than V♯_k.

*Proof.*
- **Which links enter V♯_k.** V♯_k is a function of the sixteen paths P_x = U_{x,μ} U_{x+e_μ,μ}, x ∈ B(y). This includes
  the cut-off χ_k, which uses the same paths, and P_{2y}. The tree links are I. Every link (x, μ), x ∈ B(y), lies in A_W.
  A second link (x + e_μ, μ) lies off ⋃W only if x + e_μ ∉ B(y). Then o_μ(x) = 1 and x + e_μ ∈ B(y + e_μ), so
  y + e_μ ∉ W.
- **It enters no other average.** The averages of direction ν ≠ μ use only links of direction ν. An average V♯_{y′,μ}
  uses links with base in B(y′) ∪ B(y′ + e_μ). For j the second option forces y′ = y, and the first is excluded since
  j's base is not in ⋃W.
- **No shared plaquette.** Since y ∈ W and y + e_μ ∉ W, y_μ = n/2 − 1. So x_μ = 2y_μ + 1 = n − 1, and j = (z, μ)
  with z_μ = n.
  - A plaquette through j lies in a plane (μ, ν) and spans the μ-interval [n, n + 1].
  - Its four links have base z, z + e_μ, z ± e_ν or z ± e_ν + e_μ, all with μ-coordinate n or n + 1.
  - So no link of the plaquette has base in [0, n)⁴, and none is in A_W.
- **Private links (iii).** (x, μ) with o_μ(x) = 1 is a link of direction μ with base in B(y). It enters only averages of
  direction μ, of blocks y′ with B(y′) ∋ x or B(y′ + e_μ) ∋ x. The second needs x ∈ B(y′ + e_μ) = B(y), so y′ = y − e_μ,
  and there it would be in S^μ_y, which consists of links with o_μ = 0. Hence only V♯_{y,μ}. ∎

Checked by enumeration for n = 4 and n = 6 (`checks/d5_geometry.py`): all type-(b) links found share no plaquette with
A_W. The same script checks the following:
- every type-(a) link shares exactly one plaquette with each of its A_W-neighbours;
- it has at most 5 such neighbours (we use the trivial bound 18 = 6 plaquettes × 3 links);
- all of them lie at link distance ≤ 1.

**Counting.** A link coupled to A_W has base in [−1, n]⁴. In a class (a residue mod 2 and a direction) there are at
most (n/2 + 1)⁴ − (n/2)⁴ ≤ 4(n/2 + 1)³ such exterior links (checked: 43 ≤ 108 at n = 4, 134 ≤ 256 at n = 6).

## 3. Theorem 1 (type (a))

**Theorem 1.** Let (E, c) be calm, and let j be a type-(a) link. Then

c_{V,j}(E, c) ≤ C_* + 120 r λ ε_W(K, λ) |A_W|,

where C_* = 480 √18 e^{α_G} p̄_{α_G}² S(α_G)^{1/2}, and

S(α) = sup_j Σ_a e^{−2α d(a,j)} ≤ 4(24α⁻⁴ + 24α⁻³ + 12α⁻² + 4α⁻¹ + 1).

At α_G = 2.5·10⁻⁴ and p̄ ≤ 4.8: S ≤ 2.4582·10¹⁶ and C_* ≤ 7.36·10¹². For SU(2), r = 2.

*Proof.*

**Step 1: exact derivative.**
- By Lemma 1(ii) the fibre F = F_{E_t}(c), as a subset of G^{A_W}, does not depend on t. So J does not depend on t
  either, and π_t := π_{E_t,c} has density ∝ e^{−λQ_t} with respect to the fixed finite measure J⁻¹ dvol_F.
- Q_t − Q_0 involves only the plaquettes p ∋ j, and t ↦ Q_t is smooth. F is compact, so for bounded measurable F,

  (d/dt) E_{π_t} F |_{t=0} = −λ Cov_{π_0}(F, Q̇),  Q̇ = Σ_{p∋j} DQ_p[Z_j].

- The derivative is continuous in t, so t ↦ E_{π_t}F is C¹. It suffices to treat smooth F with per-link Lipschitz
  constant ≤ 1: mollify on G^{A_W} (a 1-Lipschitz function is a uniform limit of smooth functions with per-link
  gradient ≤ 1 + η).

**Step 2: split at the chart.**
- Let A = Φ_{U^0}(Ω_r), p = π_0(A), μ = π_0(·|A) and ν = π_0(·|A^c). By the law of total covariance,

  Cov_{π_0}(F, G) = p Cov_μ(F, G) + (1−p) Cov_ν(F, G) + p(1−p)(E_μF − E_νF)(E_μG − E_νG).

- Since |Cov_ν(F, G)| ≤ ¼ osc F osc G and 1 − p ≤ ε_W,

  |Cov_{π_0}(F, G)| ≤ |Cov_μ(F, G)| + (5/4) ε_W osc F osc G.

**Step 3: the chart term.**
- Apply Theorem `chartdecay`(ii) with φ = d(·, j) (1-Lipschitz on all indices) and α = α_G:

  |Cov_μ(F, Q̇)| ≤ (120/λ) ‖e^{−αφ}∇′F‖_{L²(μ)} ‖e^{αφ}∇′Q̇‖_{L²(μ)}.

- As in the proof of Proposition `explicitdecay`(iii), ∇′F = P̄* g^F, where g^F is the gradient of F(U e^X) in X, and
  |g^F_a| ≤ 2 for every a. Hence

  |e^{−αφ}∇′F| ≤ ‖P̄‖_{(α)} |e^{−αφ} g^F|₂ ≤ 2 p̄ S(α)^{1/2}.

- For Q̇, use the bound |D²Q_p[Y, Z]| ≤ 2(Σ_{e∈p}|Y_e|)(Σ_{e∈p}|Z_e|) of that proof (Duhamel). It is valid for the
  mixed derivative in X_a and in the exterior coordinate t, because both enter as U_e e^{X_e}.
  - So g^{Q̇}_a := ∇_a Q̇ obeys |g^{Q̇}_a| ≤ 2 m(a, j), with m(a, j) ≤ 1 the number of plaquettes containing a and j.
  - It vanishes unless a shares a plaquette with j: at most 18 links, all at distance ≤ 1 from j (Lemma 1, checks).
  - Hence |e^{αφ}∇′Q̇| ≤ p̄ e^{α} 2√18.
- So λ|Cov_μ(F, Q̇)| ≤ 120 · 2p̄S^{1/2} · 2√18 e^α p̄ = C_*.

**Step 4: the off-chart term.**
- osc F ≤ diam_{d_V} ≤ 2√r |A_W|, since δ ≤ 2√r on U(r).
- |DQ_p[Z]| ≤ 2‖U_p − I‖ ≤ 4√r for the ≤ 6 plaquettes through j, so osc Q̇ ≤ 48√r.
- So λ(5/4)ε_W osc F osc Q̇ ≤ 120 r λ ε_W |A_W|. ∎

**The lattice sum.**
- N(R) := #{a : d(a, j) ≤ R} ≤ 4(2R + 1)⁴: four directions, and per coordinate at most ⌊2R⌋ + 1 points of a shifted
  copy of ℤ in an interval of length 2R.
- By the layer-cake formula, Σ_a e^{−2αd(a,j)} = ∫₀^∞ 2α e^{−2αR} N(R) dR ≤ 4 Σ_{k=0}^4 C(4,k) k! α^{−k}.
- The script sums the exact ℓ^∞ shells: 2.45760·10¹⁶ ≤ 2.45821·10¹⁶.

**Remarks.**
1. **Independence of λ.** The amplitude 120/λ of the chart covariance cancels the factor λ of the boundary coupling.
   This is why C_* does not depend on β. The same cancellation makes the Gaussian coefficient ‖u_j‖₁ of Theorem
   `constrainedcube` independent of b.
2. **The weight is essential.** With α = 0 the same argument gives 120 · 2|A_W|^{1/2} · 2√18, which grows with the cube.
   The exponential weight of `chartdecay`(ii), not (iii), is what makes the bound uniform in n. Using (iii) link by link
   instead loses Σ_a |X_1||X_2| and gives the same order, with c_9 in place of 120 p̄².
3. **Size of C_*.** The constant is dominated by α_G⁻² ≈ 1.6·10⁷ from S^{1/2}. The floating-point decay of the chart
   Hessian quoted in Remark `chartdecayopen` (factor ≈ 0.4 per unit distance) suggests that the true C_* is of order
   10²–10³.

## 4. Theorem 2 (type (b)): transport along the private links

Let j be type (b), k = (y, μ) its average, Pr the 8 private links of k, and x_j the site with j = (x_j + e_μ, μ).

**Construction.**
- **The analytic region.** On R = {U : m_y(U, E) < ρ_G/2}, where m_y = max_{x∈B(y)} δ(P_x, P_{2y}), the cut-off is
  χ_k ≡ 1, the logarithms are principal, and V♯_k is real-analytic in (U, E_j).
- **The transport field.** By Lemma `privatesubmersion` the derivative J_k of V♯_k along Pr satisfies J_k J_k* ≥ σ_0²,
  σ_0 = (1 − 7Λ/8)/√2 = 0.03105. Define on R

  Y_t(U) = −J_k*(J_k J_k*)⁻¹ ∂_t c_k(U, E_t) on Pr, and 0 elsewhere.

  - By Lemma 1(i),(iii), the flow Θ_t of Y_t maps F_{E_0}(c) ∩ R into F_{E_t}(c) and preserves every other constraint.
  - Only P_{x_j} depends on j, with weight 1/16, so |∂_t c_k| ≤ Λ/16 (the bound on the logarithm's derivative used in
    the proof of `privatesubmersion`, with dexp of norm ≤ 1). Hence |Y|₂ ≤ Λ/(16σ_0) = 2.1994 and |Y|₁ ≤ √8 |Y|₂ ≤ 6.23.
- **The localisation.** Let ψ = Σ_x δ(P_x, P_{2y})², which is smooth. Let θ be a smooth cut-off with θ = 1 on
  [0, ρ_G²/64] and θ = 0 on [ρ_G²/16, ∞), and put θ_t = θ(ψ(·, E_t)). Then supp θ_t ⊂ {m_y < ρ_G/4} ⊂ R.
  - On the chart, every path of block y is within O(κ + s) ≪ ρ_G/8 of P_{2y}. So θ ≡ 1 there, and θ̇ = 0 there.

**The derivative.**
- Write ν_t for the unnormalised measure on F_{E_t}(c) and Z_t for its mass. Pull back the θ_t part by Θ_t. Then
  Θ_t⁻¹_#(θ_t ν_t) has a smooth density relative to ν_0 on F_{E_0}(c) ∩ R. Its logarithmic derivative at t = 0 is

  ℓ̇ = −λ DQ[Y] + ω.

  - The first term: the action moves only through Pr, since j itself is in no plaquette meeting A_W.
  - ω collects the t-derivatives of log J and of the fibre Jacobian of Θ_t. It does not depend on λ.
- Differentiating E_{π_t}F = (∫Fθ_t dν_t + ∫F(1 − θ_t) dν_t)/Z_t gives

  (d/dt) E_{π_t}F |₀ = E_{π_0}[θ ⟨∇F, Y⟩] + Cov_{π_0}(F, θℓ̇ + θ̇) + Ξ_j(F),

  where Ξ_j(F) = (d/dt)[∫F(1−θ_t)dν_t − E_{π_0}F ∫(1−θ_t)dν_t]/Z_0, taken as an upper Dini derivative.

**Theorem 2.** For calm (E, c) and type-(b) j,

c_{V,j}(E, c) ≤ √8|Y|₂ + C_b + (5/4) ε_W osc F osc(θℓ̇) + sup_F |Ξ_j(F)|,

with

C_b = 240 p̄² S^{1/2} e^{3α_G} (48|Y|₂ + 12κ′C′_G) + 240 p̄² S^{1/2} C″_G/λ.

- The leading part, 240 · 48 p̄² S^{1/2} e^{3α}|Y|₂ = 9.16·10¹³, is explicit and independent of λ.
- osc(θℓ̇) ≤ 48√r λ|Y|₁ + C_G.

*Proof of the explicit part.*
- **First term.** |⟨∇F, Y⟩| ≤ |Y|₁.
- **Chart term.**
  - On the chart, θ = 1 and θ̇ = 0, so the chart covariance is Cov_μ(F, ℓ̇).
  - ∇_X(DQ[Y]) = D²Q[Y, ·] + DQ[DY ·].
  - The first piece, as a functional, has norm ≤ 48|Y|₂ (the bound ‖D²Q‖ ≤ 48 of `explicitdecay`). It is supported on
    links that share a plaquette with Pr, all within distance 3 of j, so its weight is ≤ e^{3α}.
  - The second piece is at most 12κ′|DY|, and |DY| ≤ C′_G by analyticity on R.
  - Insert these into `chartdecay`(ii) as in Theorem 1.
- **Off-chart term.** Exactly as Step 4 of Theorem 1, with |DQ[Y]| ≤ 24√r|Y|₁. ∎

*What is only sketched.*
- The constants C′_G and C″_G are not computed. C″_G bounds |e^{αφ}∇′ω|.
- ω is a trace of (Dc Dc*)⁻¹ against a perturbation localised near k. Globally Dc Dc* ≥ σ_0², because it is
  block-diagonal on the private links.
- On the chart the weighted-norm calculus of `explicitdecay` (Lemma `weightednorms`) bounds the gradient. This is
  routine, but it is not written out.
- Both C′_G and C″_G enter only multiplied by κ′ or 1/λ, so they do not affect the leading constant for large β.

*What is open.*
- Ξ_j. It concerns only the part of the fibre where some path of the single block y is at least ρ_G/8 from straight.
  Its total mass is ≤ ε_W, but its derivative in E_j is not controlled.
  - On {m_y > ρ_G} the constraint V♯_k = P_{2y} does not depend on j. So only the cut-off shell ρ_G/8 ≤ m_y ≤ ρ_G and
    the motion of its boundary contribute.
- **Conjecture B.** |Ξ_j(F)| ≤ C (1 + λ) π_0(m_y ≥ ρ_G/8) for 1-Lipschitz F.
  This is a one-block large-field statement, part of D7. It is plausible because everything moves at speed O(1) and
  the action enters with λ. But the cut-off shell has kinks (χ is piecewise linear, and m_y is a maximum), and a proof
  would need either a smooth cut-off with the `privatesubmersion` bound or a coarea argument across the kinks.

## 5. Corollary and what is left

**Corollary 2 (conditional).** Assume:
- every (E_s, c) on the geodesics involved is calm;
- Ξ_j ≤ C_Ξ for every type-(b) link;
- λ ε_W |A_W| ≤ 1.

Then K^c_c ≤ 4(n/2 + 1)³ (π/2)(max(C_*, C_b) + C_Ξ + O(1)), where the O(1) includes 120r and the small terms. So
D_c(n, α) holds on calm data for

(n/2)⁴ α ≥ 4(n/2 + 1)³ · 1.44·10¹⁴(1 + C_Ξ/C_b), that is, n ≥ 2.3·10¹⁵(1 + C_Ξ/C_b)/α up to O(1),

for α ≤ 1/2 (`checks/d5_geometry.py`: n ≥ 2.302·10¹⁵ at α = 1/2 and 1.151·10¹⁶ at α = 1/10 when C_Ξ = 0).

**The non-uniform term, precisely.** In Theorems 1 and 2, the only quantity that grows with the cube is the off-chart
term (5/4) ε_W osc F osc G. It is crude in two ways:
- osc F ∼ |A_W| charges the whole cube;
- ε_W is the probability that *some* plaquette in the cube is large.

What would make D5 uniform along the tuning is a localised version:

**Conjecture L (local off-chart covariance).** For calm (E, c), a 1-Lipschitz F and G a smooth function of links within
distance 1 of j with per-link gradient ≤ 1,

|Cov_{π}(F, G) − Cov_μ(F, G)| ≤ C Σ_x e^{−α d(x,j)} π(some plaquette at x is not calm).

With the per-site rarity of large plaquettes (D6, Theorem `defects`, extended to arbitrary exteriors: ROADMAP §7 item
3), the right-hand side is O(q(β_W) S(α)), uniform in |W|. Conjecture L is the same statement as "large fields are
harmless" (D7) in covariance form. This is where the annealed Dobrushin comparison (ROADMAP §7 item 2) and the
transport of the island bound to chart coordinates (item 4) would enter:
- **Islands.** Inside an island of bad plaquettes the single-link W₁ coefficients are bounded uniformly in the field
  (`D_STATUS.md` §3).
- **Leaving an island.** The chart decay of this note controls the influence once it leaves the island.
- **The missing step.** The two have to be glued in one metric, and the section S of the chart (row sums ≤ 14, range 1)
  is the natural change of metric.

**Averaging over v.** Lemma `mixture` holds with ε replaced by ∫W₁(κ(·|v), κ′(·|v)) ρ(dv). Its proof integrates the
first term against ρ. So Corollary `compose` only needs the constrained coefficient *on average* over the averages v,
under the law of the averages given the exterior. That law gives the non-calm fibres mass ≤ ε″_W (Corollary
`calmexterior`). This does not remove the need for D4: the non-calm fibres still contribute W₁ ≤ diam, which is not
proportional to δ. But it shows that only their mass, not a supremum over them, is needed if D4 is proved in a form
proportional to δ.
